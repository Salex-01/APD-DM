--  LeLann algorithm  --

	Each node that can become the leader sends a message containing its ID to its neighbor (on its right)
	Each candidate node creates a list of the IDs of all the candidates
	Each node repeats the messages it receives to its neighbor (on its right)
	When a node receives a message containing its ID, it stops it, computes the minimum ID present in its list, and becomes the leader if it is the same as its own ID
	
Algorithm: (the message is called "water")

1:if InitNode then
2:	send own ID to right neighbor

3:forever
4:	receive ID from left neighbor
5:	if ID == own ID
6:		compute minimum in list
7:		if minimum == own ID
8:			leader = true
9:		else
10:			leader = false
11:	else
12:		add ID to list
13:		send ID to right neighbor
